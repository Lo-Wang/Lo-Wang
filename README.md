    <summary><h3> My Coding Way :milky_way:</h3></summary>
    I started studying programming a relatively long time ago, in my 4rd year at university. Then I chose C# as my first language. The first programs for calculating laboratory work and the first game were written. Next, I started writing embedded software for the stm32 microcontroller and at the same time developing an interface for managing Windows OS. In the middle of development, I was offered to work in C++, it was my first commercial experience. At the same time, I started making my project in C# for convenient reading of books in Telegram - full library functionality and reading books on "semantic" sentences. At the moment, there are thoughts about assembling your microcontroller and the smooth operation of the bot. Next, the application is a Pomodoro timer, because the timer in Windows does not have the necessary functionality. It's still in development.
    <p> At the moment, I am developing mathematical animation in Python for a large educational project VisualMath (in the future VisualUniverse), and also studying data analysis using NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
